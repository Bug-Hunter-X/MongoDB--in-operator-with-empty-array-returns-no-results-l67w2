# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MongoDB queries when using the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The query incorrectly returns an empty result set, rather than returning all documents.

## Bug
The bug is located in `bug.js`.  The query uses `$in` with an empty array, resulting in unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`. It shows how to handle empty arrays appropriately in queries using $in. If there is a need to retrieve all documents, then the $in operator should be avoided or a condition check should be added before the query to handle empty arrays.
